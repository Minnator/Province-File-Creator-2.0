# Province File Creator 2.0

A programm to automatically create province files after presets.

**If anything doesnt work enable the _override_ option.**
**_override_ is required to edit already existing provinces** *(current workaround)*

This is just the tip of the iceberg. A way more powerful tool is currently in development (--> https://github.com/Minnator/EU4-Libary)
or if you are searching for an already amazing tool try to look for **Chleb's Mod Editor** in either the *EU4 Modathon* or the *EU4 Mod Coop* discord server!
